# Hello-World
This is the unforgetable Hello World !!
I am hoping GOD is listening....you are all I have left !
You have taken away from me all that I ever wanted. When my fatherthrew my mom on the floor it was the beginning of loss for me. You allowed a high school girl take my father and break my family.  It took the concept of the meaning of home for me. From that moment on - all you did was take - take - take. Kim was the girl I loved and wanted. You had her break my heart because of the guy from FELLERS was fucking her.Remember the chase through the neighborhood. I left for college and met several girls - but I was a scared broken hearted kid. Conniewhile I loved her broke my heart. You give me Frances - but make her unreachable. Well There is more to this story - in the d - I thought one day you would just giveme just a little happiness. You haven't - I should b one that takes the gun to those that have wronged me - yet I don't. Give me something....the lottery, a really hot girl.....how about the P.R. job?  I think I have eared to at least have that. I won't mind killing myself to make that job happen - yet I don't feel you will give it to me. Please giveme something before I self destruct !!
